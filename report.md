## Introduction 
Pandas is an open source, BSD-licensed library that provides high performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis for Python. 
Listed below are some key features of Pandas:
- DataFrame object for data manipulation with integrated indexing
- Tools for reading and writing data between in-memory data structures and different formats: CSV and text files, Microsoft Excel, SQL databases, and the fast HDF5 format
- Intelligent data alignment and integrated handling of missing data
- Label-based slicing and fancy indexing
- High performance merging and joining of data sets
- Time series-functionality
- Optimized for performance, most code written in Cython or C.

NumFOCUS provides Pandas with financial, legal and administrative support. NumFOCUS is also the backer of many other popular open source Python packages. In addition to NumFOCUS, Pandas also has institutional partners: University of Paris-Saclay, Two Sigma and Anaconda.
